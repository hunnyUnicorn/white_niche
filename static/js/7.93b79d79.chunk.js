With over six years of professional experience, our full-stack developer exemplifies self-motivation and a passion for problem-solving. We thrive on challenges and constantly push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in the tech world.\n\n# Currently\n\nOur expertise lies in building robust teams, managing people effectively, shaping positive company culture, and developing strong customer relationships. We excel in selling enterprise products and creating online predictive models using cutting-edge technologies like Dask, Dagster, TensorFlow, and spaCy.\n\n# Some history\n\nOur journey in technology began in 1998 with a humble Tandy computer running MS-DOS. This early exposure to computing sparked a lifelong passion for technology. From playing games like Street Rod 2 and Wolfenstein 3D to exploring the depths of AOL in 2001, our fascination with computers only grew stronger.\n\nIn 2002, a pivotal moment came when we installed MegaRace on a family computer, leading to countless hours of exploration and experimentation. By the age of seven, we were already delving into the mini-games hidden within Microsoft Office and mastering Minesweeper on expert mode.\n\nAt eight, our first digital camera, a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71, opened up a new world of photography. This passion for capturing moments has stayed with us, evolving into a love for photography with advanced equipment like the Nikon D750, D800, and the Mamiya 6II.\n\nBy the age of ten, we were creating our first website with Microsoft FrontPage on a Pentium III Gateway. Though rudimentary, it marked the beginning of a journey into web development. A year later, we built our first Tesla Coil, followed by several more innovative versions, including audio modulated coils and DRSSTCs.\n\nAt twelve, we showcased our ingenuity by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols at a local laser tag facility, setting an all-time high score. This early experience in hacking and engineering laid the foundation for future technological endeavors.\n\n# Fun facts\n\nWe have a list of thousands of creative ideas, ranging from matching bow ties for cats and humans to innovative tech solutions. A sketchbook and a 01 Sakura Pigma Micron Pen are our constant companions, capturing thoughts and sketches on the go. Although we can't locate every country on a map, our curiosity about the world remains boundless.\n\nWe added this page to our portfolio because many people felt our site was too focused on our resume. We hope this gives you a better sense of who we are beyond our professional accomplishments.",u=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,d=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(t.jsx)(a.b,Object(i.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(t.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Chunji Piao",children:Object(t.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(t.jsx)("header",{children:Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(t.jsx)(a.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Us"})}),Object(t.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",u," words)"]})]})}),Object(t.jsx)(r.a,{source:c,renderers:{Link:d},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
